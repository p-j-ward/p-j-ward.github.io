While searching for a way to take logs on an FPGA (without resorting to the sledgehammer of CORDIC) I stumbled upon Micheal Dunn's [Single-cycle logarithms & antilogs](https://www.edn.com/single-cycle-logarithms-antilogs/) article in EDN. His method is a clever extention of the mathematician's approximation: to take the log (base 10), just count the digits. In binary we can get the log (base 2) by "counting the digits" with a priority encoderâ€”which outputs the position of the highest nonzero bit.

This bit-counting is pretty cheap, and gives us the integer part of the log. Next is is the clever bit: we can get the fractional part by left-aligning the input with a barrel shifter (by left shifting the input by the binary not of the integer part) then feeding that into a LUT (???). How on earth that works (and besides... what goes in the LUT?) is what I want to analyse here, as it falls quite neatly out of some simple algebra, with a few tricks.

(TODO: add diagram here)

To work out the behaviour mathematically, first consider the priority encoder output $$P_O$$, which is the floor of the log (base 2). The floor of $$\lfloor a \rfloor$$ is simply $$a - \{a\}$$ where $$\{a\}$$ denotes the fractional part of $$a$$, thus for input value $$x$$:

$$ P_O = \lfloor \log_{2}x \rfloor = \log_{2}x - \{\log_{2}x\} $$
